## Project Name - Bakeland

A Fully on chain and cross chain game to play against friends and foes alike across the leading GameFi ecosystems. 

## Project Description

Bakeland is a cross chain war game catering two major type of crypto native audiance 
  1. **Chain Hoppers** - people who hop around the chains for better incentives
  2. **Chain loyalist** - People who are are loyal to one chain

Bakeland put these users from different chains in single battleground which has a unified global state. Players can do multiple activites and can have multiple roles.

Two major roles which determine game mechanics are 
  1. **FARMER** - Staked $BUDS and get boosted staking rewards
  2. **NARC** - Raids staking pools on any chain

User can acquire these roles by getting a **FARMER** or **NARC** NFT. 

Users can do following operations despite :-

  1. **Staking** - User can stake in-game native token $BUDS to get staking rewards. One can stake on same chain or other chain as well depending on APR offered by a chain.
  2. **Raiding** - User can raid the staking pools of any chain. Only NARC NFT holders can perform raids. It is probablistic and dependent on a probablistic success rate derived from various factors. (We have used Supra dVRF for on chain randomness)
  3. **Gambling for booster NFTs and extra rewards **- User can burn some amount of $BUDS in return for 50% chance of winning a Booster NFT which will help to increase staking reward or raid success chances. (We have used Supra dVRF for on chain randomness)
  4.** Play PvP minigames **against other players.
  5. **bridge tokens and NFTs** from one chain to another chain in game itself.
